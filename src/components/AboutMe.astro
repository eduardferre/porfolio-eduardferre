      I'm Eduard, although everyone knows me as Edu! At 15 years old, I learned
      programming logic and was able to create a Brick Breaker with Visual
      Basic. Years later, I pursued a <strong
        >double degree in Aerospace Engineering and Software Engineering</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although I developed multiple projects with different technologies during
      my degree, it wasn't until my final year that I decided to develop
      software and <strong>work as an intern at G+D for over a year</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There, I learned to <strong
        >work in an <em class="italic">Agile team</em> and adapt to new technologies</strong
      >. During my evolution as a <strong
        ><em class="italic">Software Engineer Intern</em></strong
      >, I created a gym application as my final degree project, which turned
      out to be a great success.
